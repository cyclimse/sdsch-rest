# SDSCH Rest

## Usage

The lab will be done in Python on a jupyter notebook. You will need to install some Python dependencies. We recommend to use a Python venv as to not affect your existing installation.

Here is one way to do it:

```console
python -m venv myvenv
source myvenv/bin/activate
python -m pip install flask flask-cors
jupyter-notebook . 
```

You can also install jupyter-notebook in your virtual environment if you do not have it on your computer by adding `jupyter-notebook` to the installation command.

```console
python -m pip install flask flask-cors jupyter-notebook
```

Make sure to select the right Python environment in the jupyter client. In any case, let us know if you have any trouble getting the lab to work on your machine and we will try and assist you to the best of our abilities.

## Web client
